# Chapter 1

In this chapter, we will learn about the basic data types and control structures of the Java language.

## The key points of this chapter are:

* In Java, all methods are declared in a class. You invoke a non static method on an object of the class to which the method belongs.
* Static methods are now invoked on objects. Program execution starts with the static 'main' method.
* Java has eight primitive types: five integral types, two floating-point types, and boolean.
* String objects are sequences of characters or, more precisely, Unicode code points in the UTF-16 encoding.
* Arrays and collections can be used to collect elements of the same type.
