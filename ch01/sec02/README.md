# Chapter 1.2 - Primitive Types

This simplest Java types are called 'primitive types'. Four of them are integer types, two are floating-point number types, one is the character type 'char' that is used in the encoding for strings, and one is the boolean type for truth values.

## Integer Types

Type  | Storage requirement | Range (inclusive)
----- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------
int   | 4 bytes             | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
long  | 8 bytes             | -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
short | 2 bytes             | -32,768 to 32,767
byte  | 1 bytes             | -128 to 127


## Floating Types

Type   | Storage requirement | Range (inclusive)
------ | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------
float  | 4 bytes             | Approximately ±3.40282347E+38F (6-7 significant decimal digits)
double | 8 bytes             | Approximately ±1.79769313486231570E (15 significant decimal digits)
